This scratch project will create a websocket connection to Unibet website, you can
see the same websocket if you go to https://www.unibet.com/betting#filter/all/all/all/all/in-play.
The task consists in:
1) Analyze the protocol and the messages exchanged in the unibet websocket
3) Retrieve information about sport events that are currently live and subscribe 
through the websocket to these events
2) Write some code in unibet_message_handler.py that translate the messages
coming from unibet to something that is more general and e qual for all the sportbook used.
You can see an example of the structure in the file create_event.json.
